New features and changes since tin-2.4.0

New features
------------
- jump to article in posting history screen ('W')
- ThreadTagParts ('T') in thread level
- filter articles based on Path, see doc/filtering for details
- allow multibyte chars (e.g. emojis) as art_marked_*

Changes
-------
Subjects are now normalized if local charset is UTF-8 and system supports it
(for better threading).

With the new GNKSA_MISSING_REALNAME return code for filtering filter rules
with "gnksa=>NUM" may need inspection if filtering on missing real names is
desired.

sigfile=!/path/to/command no longer passes the name of the current
newsgroup to command. One can specify %G which will be replaced by
the name of the current newsgroup to match the old behaviour:
'sigfile=!/path/to/command %G'.

--enable-cancel-locks requires libcanlock-3 (which is included, but
some distros (e.g. debian) are linking against a shared lib which may
be too old).

"make install" no longer strips the tin binary

Retired Features
----------------
. tinrc and attributes option auto_save for saving articles based on the
  Archive-name:-"header", it didn't work with NOV present and the logic
  was shar(1)-archive centric and didn't work for FAQs or the like.
