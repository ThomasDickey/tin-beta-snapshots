New Features
------------

. Rebindable keys

. New pager
     Parses and displays MIME articles
     Single line scrolling with Up/Down
     URL's are highlighted
     URL's can be launched with 'U'

. GPG support
     PGP/GPG support honours 'from' attribute

. NLS support

. Charset conversion using iconv(3) for sending and displaying articles in
  a different charset than the terminal tin runs on. The charsets are
  customizable with tinrc-option and group-attribute mm_network_charset
  (outgoing) and group-attribute undeclared_charset.
  --disable-mime-strict-charset is a noop with working charset conversion.
  The charset of the terminal is detected automatically if possible (using
  nl_langinfo(3)).

. Indicator for articles newer than n-days
  See manpage for new tinrc variables: recent_time and art_marked_recent

. art_mark_read, art_mark_killed, art_mark_selected are now configurable
  in the usual ways. See the manpage for details.

. Piping '|' now works on the thread menu

. batch_save (tinrc and attribute) can now be used to control which groups
  are affected by tin -S, -N, -M. See the manpage.

. configurable scrolling via scroll_lines

. configurable URL handler via url_handler

. '.' sorts the newsgroup list

- tin(5) manpage which describes the format of the various (config) files
  used

Changes
-------

. 'K' on the thread menu will now skip threads
  similar to 'K' on the group menu

. tin will no longer re-connect to the news server in order to just disconnect

. Lots of bug fixes

. xref filter rules are now matched against a the reformatted xref line
  (same format as Newsgroups:, everything except the newsgoup names is
  stripped, the remaining groups are comma seperated) instead of matching
  against each group except listed (except the current one) iduvidually

Retired Features
----------------

. INDEX_DAEMON is no longer supported

. -U indexing is no longer supported

. ~/.tin/headers file is no longer directly supported. Use:
  	scope=*
  	x_headers=~/.tin/headers
  or an equivalent instead

. ~/.tin/bug_address is no longer supported. Set a site-wide address either
  at compile time or set in the tin.defaults file.

. 'k' no longer works in the pager. Use 'N' instead

. display_mime_header_asis, display_mime_allheader_asis
  By default the pager decodes headers. Use ^H to toggle to undecoded view

. full_page_scroll and show_last_line_prev_page have been superceded by
  scroll_lines

. word_h_display_marks=3 as there is no word highligthing in signatures
  anymore

. tab_after_X_selection as it was broken for several years and nobody
  complained about it

. --with-local-charset as the ports (NeXT, MSDOS) where it was needed
  weren't maintained for several years now.

. filter rules xref_num and xref_score have been removed, the new format
  of the xref rule should give you nearly the same functionailty
