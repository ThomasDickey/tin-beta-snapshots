short descriptions of files in the tools-directory

w2r.pl
	is a small perl script that turns a wildmat filter file
	into a regexp filter file (don't forget to set wildmat= in tinrc
	accordingly)
	usage:
	w2r.pl < wildmat-filter-file > regexp-filter-file

opt-case.pl
	is a small perl script that tries to opt out case insensitive
	regexp, it will put a comment above each line it touched.
	usage:
	opt-case.pl < regexp-filter-file > regexp-filter-file-case

	w2r.pl and opt-case.pl might be used together, i.e:
	w2r.pl < wildmat-filter-file | opt-case.pl > regexp-filter-file-case

tinlock
	is a small shell script that creates a lockfile before starting
	tin to avoid multiple copies of tin running, when tin exits cleanly
	the lockfile is removed; tinlock will warn about suspicious
	locks/deadlocks. tinlock is kind of NFS safe.
	usage:
	tinlock [tin-cmdline-args]

metamutt
	is a small shell script to replace metamail, set METAMAIL=metamutt
	before starting tin and till will pass multipart MIME-articles to
	metamutt instead of metamail. metamutt will pass the article to mutt
	(a mail client with an excellent MIME-parser). this might become
	obsolete as tin now has a small (and unfinished) builtin
	MIME-parser, set METAMAIL=(internal) to use the builtin version.

url_handler.sh
	is a shell script (need to be placed in /usr/local/bin/) which
	passes the URL selected by the 'U' command in to to a related
	viewer/application. this one is very basic.

expand_aliases.tgz
	is a small c-source which reads you elm-aliasfile, translates the
	alias into the real address and passes it to the MTA. see included
	README-file/man-page for more details.

expiretover
	is a small shell script to expire old tin overview files. if you
        use cache_overview_files=ON in your tinrc you might want to run this
	script reguarly (i.e. once a day from cron) to purge old overview
	files.
