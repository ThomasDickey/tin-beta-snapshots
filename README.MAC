Compiling tin for MacOS X:

First, you need the developer packages installed (CD 2).

configure needs at least the argument:
--with-domain-name=<your domain>

Compile tin, install it and run in a ISO-8859-1 terminal.

Instead of using the shell-script url_handler.sh you might want
to use open(1) as URL-handler.
