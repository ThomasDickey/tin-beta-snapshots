=========

3.2.2      2021-01-07
           Bugfix: Header field name is not found by canlock-mhp if there
            is another header field for which only the prefix differs (and
            that other field is processed first)
           Test suite for canlock-mhp parser extended: It now tests headers
            larger than 4 KiByte and for the field prefix bug fixed in this
            version
           Lexer of canlock-hfp has problems to detect T_CTEXT tokens on
            HP-UX (relevant only if the header field contains comments).
            The syntax of the ERE for T_CTEXT was rewritten to be compatible
            with the SysV lex of HP-UX 11.11
           Test suite for canlock-hfp parser extended to test comments harder
           Namespace clash of internal library functions with libc on NetBSD
            Changed internal API function names hmac* to RFC2104Hmac*
            Changed internal API function names hkdf* to RFC5869Hkdf*
            Library API and ABI are fully compatible if no undocumented
            functions are used
           libcanlock-3.pc: Changed protocol in URL from http to https

3.2.1      2020-11-28
           Bugfix: off-by-one heap buffer overflow fixed in canlock-mhp
            (If header is larger than 4 KiByte. Found by Valgrind)
           Bugfix: canlock-mhp end of header detection fixed
            (Found by test suite on openSUSE. Reported by Martin Hauke)

3.2.0      2020-05-11
           Support for pkg-config with option "--enable-pc-files" added
            (Default behaviour is unchanged). This option installs the
            pkg-config file "libcanlock-3.pc". The standard option
            "--with-pkgconfigdir" can be used to specify the target directory
           Shared library no longer exports internal symbols, if possible
            (using #pragma GCC visibility). Library API and ABI are fully
            compatible if no undocumented functions are used.
           Build system: Distributed autotools files updated

3.1.1      2019-12-29
           Bugfix: Potential buffer overflows in code from RFC6234 fixed.
            Related code is used for test suite only, installed library and
            utilities are not affected (Reported by Florian Schlichting)
           Build system: Makefile rules fixed that use DIST_SUBDIRS variable
           src/canlock.c: Fixed typo in comment (Reported by Urs Janssen)

            canlock-hp, use this option to get the behaviour from 3.0.x)

           Library API and ABI are unchanged

3.0.3      2018-12-05

           Function to overwrite secret data in memory added
           Command line utility added
           Test program for new API added
           Test program for SHA implementation replaced
