VERSION 0:

21 Sep 1998
        - Endianness is now automatically figured out by build.

19 Sep 1998
        - Added MD5 hashes.
        - We now accommodate the possibility that strings will be identified
          by name instead of number, those darned drafts will get you every
          time.
        - Make changes to the hmac stuff to account for GCC weirdness; some
          check values were not coming out correctly, but they are now.

15 Sep 1998
        - Initial, just SHA-1.
