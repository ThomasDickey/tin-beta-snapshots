VERSION 1:

24 Sep 1998
        - Now trying to be compatible with an updated cancel lock draft.
        - We now generate the lock by hashing the Base64 encoding of the
          cancel key, instead of the underlying binary digest.
        - the xxx_key() and xxx_lock() functions now add the md5: or sha1:
          tag to the lock.
        - lock_strip_alpha() now discards pesky clue strings and normalizes
          the case of type codes.
        - the old lock_strip() that returned numeric codes will be going
          away.
