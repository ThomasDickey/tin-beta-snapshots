VERSION 2a:

11 Aug 2003
        - Only very minor changes.  The makefile was tweaked slightly
          for increased portability, and a typo in lock_strip was fixed.

VERSION 2:

10 Aug 2003
        - Replaced the SHA-1 library with the source code from RFC 1374.
          The old code had problems on PowerPC that I was too lazy to hunt
          down and fix.
        - Replaced the ISC version of Base64 with an implementation
          produced by Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The
          old functions carried a weird patent disclaimer from IBM, while
          the new ones use a nice simple non-scary BSD license.
        - The md5_key(), md5_lock() and md5_verify() functions have been
          removed.  As far as I can tell they weren't being used.
        - Added a Makefile instead of the Build thingy.
        - Did a bunch of cleanup to get rid of various warnings.
